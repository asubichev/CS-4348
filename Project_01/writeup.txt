– How did you approach the project?
    I started the project two weeks before the due date, and planned to complete each step as specified in the instruction pdf
– How did you organize the project? Why?
    I planned to finish the programs individually in order of specification, and only at the end tie everything together with pipes
– What problems did you encounter?
    - My first problem was forgetting how to manage stdin/stdout in python
    - Getting the formatting right for output in the logger program
    - Figuring out the math behind the vigenere cipher
    - Getting input edge cases right in the encryption program
    - For some reason, when I passed 'QUIT' into the encryption program, it didn't
    - I would process number input as integers, even though all stdin comes in strings
– How did you fix them? (Respectively)
    - 1
    - 1
    - 1
    - 1
    - I had to change the encryption program's stdout to sys.stdout since otherwise print debugging wasn't working. I had to use print debuggging since for some reason, VSCode's python debugger wasn't detecting breakpoints in the processes.
        I finally figured out that I was using [:-1] to get rid of the newline character in the encryption program, and it was removing the 'T' in 'QUIT' causing problems. Ended up switching to rstrip()
    - Num input

– What did you learn doing this project?
    - I am significantly more confident in making simple python scripts


– If you did not complete some feature of the project, why not?
